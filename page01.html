                <h2>Teaching 'Direct Speech Punctuation' using the iPhone text messaging!</h2>
                <span>March 14, 2013</span>
                <p>
                    Teaching 'direct speech' is always a tricky aspect, there is so much to remember and very few useful visual pictures that
                    clearly help children know what and how to use speech punctuation properly. Lets look at some of the
                    tips to remember: The words that are spoken have to go within the speech marks. Any punctuation needs
                    to also go inside the speech marks. A reporting clause, who and how they said it can go before, middle
                    or end. A comma follows the reporting clause at the beginning. You need to start a new line when a new
                    character speaks. I think that is most of them?? I have heard of endless different ways to try and get
                    children to remember these tips - keeping the sheeps in the pen or speech mark sandwich which are a couple
                    of examples however they do not have any visual help for tips such as starting on a new line, which is
                    something some of my children find hardest to remember. I decided to use a different approach, to help
                    cover the aspects of correctly punctuating speech through text messaging. Well, not literally text messaging
                    but the idea of text messaging. iphonetextgenerator, ifaketext.com, fakephonetext.com, - are websites
                    that allow you to write a conversation between two people and it will generate a screenshot of the conversation
                    as if it was a text message on an iPhone.
                </p>
                <p>
                    I personally think this is a great visual picture that the children can use to help then punctuate speech. The clearly see
                    that:
                </p>
                <ul>
                    <li>'The words spoken in the bubble have to go inside the speech marks including the punctuation.'</li>
                    <li>'They also clearly see that every time a different character speaks they have to start a new line.'</li>
                    <li>'The reporting clause can go before or after the speech bubble.'</li>
                </ul>
                <p>
                    This is also something the children are probably used to seeing. Here would be the translation in the children's books:
                </p>
                <p>
                    'What big eyes you have?' Asked Red Riding Hood.
                    <br> The wolf replied, 'all the better for seeing you with!'
                    <br> 'What big teeth you haven't?' questioned Red.
                    <br> 'All the better to EAT YOUR WITH!!!' Screamed the Wolf.
